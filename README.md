gradle-wsdl-plugin
==================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/djmijares/gradle-wsdl-plugin/status.png)]
(https://drone.io/github.com/djmijares/gradle-wsdl-plugin/latest)

Gradle plugin that defines some conventions for web service Projects.
Eases the manual configuration of web service project by: 

      * Hooking in ant tasks to parse the wsdl with wsimport
      * Defining a convention to generate a correct WSDL name for the project,
        by parsing the project-name itself
      * Automatically finding web Service dependencies in the WSDL and
        associated schema it imports/includes
      * Populating a WAR file with all dependent Web Service Files (WSDL, XSD).

Using The Plugin
================

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories { 
    maven { 
      url 'http://dl.bintray.com/content/djmijares/gradle-plugins/'
    }
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.gradle.jacobo.plugins:gradle-wsdl-plugin:1.7.2'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'wsdl'
```

Setting Up The jaxws Configurations
===================================

You *need* the jaxws configuration to run the `wsimport` task, but that is the
only task that has an external dependency. Any version of jaxws that you care to
use will work.  I try to stay with the latest releases.

```groovy
    dependencies { 
      jaxws 'com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-tools:2.2.8-promoted-b131'
      jaxws 'com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-rt:2.2.8-promoted-b131'
    }
```

Plugin Tasks
============

* `wsimport`
	- runs wsimport ant task on the WSDL file name.
	- needs to be run manually.
	- obviously if you have an updated WSDL, you need to `wsimport` before you
      package up a `war`
* `war`
	- automatically generates the war like a regular WAR would, but also
      populates the war with all the files the wsdl depends on, in the exact
      structure as it is present on the filesystem.
	- can be run manually, but is already hooked into the `build` task
      automatically!

Artifact Output
===============

The war would look like this (see the *hello-world-episode-binding-ws* project
in the examples folder)

`wsdl` and `schema` folders are auto populated on the fly :)

Schema Organization
===================

## The Problem of Schema Document Duplication

This is probably the biggest reason for this plugin and what it attempts to do
-- have some sort of  standard for xsd and wsdl projects that use schema to
source generation and episode binding, eliminating document and generated code
duplication.

I have seen a few ways of managing schema documents in projects.  Some
duplicated xsds in the xsd project **AND** in the wsdl project, so that the WSDL
file could see those xsds.  Hard. To. Manage.

I have found that the easiest way to keep things **DRY** is to have two folders
at the root of the repository.  Which is great, but the same code ended up being
replicated for differnet projects, hence the plugin to stop the copypasta.

## Conventions I Like To Use

These are defaulted into the plugin, but you can change the naming convention,
the location convention (under a project, not under the root), or change both.

* rootDir
    * wsdl -> contains all wsdl files, all listed directly under this folder.
    * schema -> contains all schema documents (xsds), in subfolders or direct
        * episodes -> holds episode files generated by jaxb
    	* bindings -> special bindings you might write for jaxb parsing
	

With this folder layout, any subproject can know where the documents are with
`project.rootDir`, and the wsdl and xsd imports/includes can be written and
won't ever have to change.

### Schema Projects

With this convention, you can have any number of schema projects and generate
code through jaxb.  I wrote a plugin 
[gradle-jaxb-plugin](https://github.com/jacobono/gradle-wsdl-plugin) that
handles all of the steps listed below.

* generate source code from schemas
* generate episode files to `schema/episodes`
* jar up the classes as a library to re-use in wsdl projects.

This minimizes the duplicate code regeneration **like crazy**

Look at the [examples folder](examples) for some examples using the jaxb plugin.

Plugin Conventions
==================

## WSDL Location Convention

For a WSDL project, there must be at least one WSDL that the project depends
on.  This file needs to be **directly** under the wsdl folder.  Abstract WSDLs
can be saved in subfolder, but the main WSDL for the project requires this
location convention.

## WSDL Naming Conventions

These conventions are not definable -- the WSDL file **MUST**:

    * Begin with a capitalized letter
    * Use camel case (every word has their first letter capitalized)
    * End with "Service"
    * Have a .wsdl extension

i.e.
	`ChuckNorrisRoundhouseKickToTheFaceService.wsdl`

## Project Naming Conventions

The project name **MUST** also follow these conventions to find the WSDL file correctly:

    * project name is all lower case
    * every word in project name has a '-' (hyphen) to divide the words
    * must end in '-ws' (signifying that this is a web-service project)

i.e.
	`chuck-norris-roundhouse-kick-to-the-face-ws`

### What This Convention Really Helps With

Applying this plugin to all projects with the `-ws` suffix.

```groovy
subprojects { project ->
  if(project.name.endsWith("-ws")) { 
    apply plugin: 'wsdl'

    dependencies { 
      jaxws 'com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-tools:2.2.8-promoted-b131'
      jaxws 'com.sun.xml.ws:jaxws-rt:2.2.8-promoted-b131'
    }
  }
}
```

## Plugin Conventions

Listed in the following sections are the default conventions that are possible
to override if desired.

There is a nested configuration, with the `wsdl` extension being the parent to the
`wsimport` extension.  You can change these defaults with a closure in your build
script.

```groovy
    wsdl {
	  ...
      wsimport {
	    ...
	  }
    }
```
	
### WSDL Plugin Conventions

There are 4 overridable defaults that declare the location defaults above.
These defaults are changed via the `wsdl` closure.

    * wsdlFolder
	    * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir
		* i.e. "wsdl" or "WSDL", or "web-services" etc.
    * schemaFolder
	    * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir
		* i.e "schema", "XMLSchema", "xsd"
    * episodeFolder
	    * **ALWAYS** relative to `project.rootDir
		* All episode files go directly under here, no subfolders.
		* i.e. "episodes", "schema/episodes", "xsd/episodes", "XMLSchema/epiosdes"

### ws-import Conventions

These defaults are changed via the nested `wsimport` closure.
Several boolean sensible defaults are defined to be passed into the wsimport task:

	* verbose
	* keep
	* xnocompile
	* fork
	* xdebug
 
And a few other String defaults
    
	* sourceDestionationDirectory
	* target
	* wsdlLocation

`sourceDestionationDirectory` is relative to `project.projectDir`.  It is
defaulted to `src/main/java`, but can be set to anywhere in the `project.projectDir`.

For more information on the jaxws wsimport ant task options, visit [here](http://jax-ws.java.net/2.2.3/docs/wsimportant.html)

### Default Conventions

These are the current default conventions:

```groovy
wsdl {
  wsdlFolder	= "wsdl"
  schemaFolder	= "schema"
  episodeFolder = "schema/episodes"
  nameRules     = [:]
  episodes      = []
  wsimport {
    sourceDestinationDirectory = "src/main/java"
    verbose		= true
    keep		= true	
    xnocompile	= true
    fork		= false
    xdebug		= false
    target		= "2.1"
    wsdlLocation = "FILL_IN_BY_SERVER"
  }
}
```

Other Features
==============

## Got a really REALLY long WSDL name??

I have seen WSDL names that can be really long, like *REALLY* long. This becomes
a problem with the project name and wsdl naming conventions.  Before you know
it, you could have a WSDL file

  `ProjectNameIsSoLongDataManagementService.wsdl`

With a corresponding project name of

     `project-name-is-so-long-data-management-ws`

This is just too long of a project name for me (the WSDL can be that long if
that is how it is named, but not the project name)!

A tidy feature I added is something called a "nameRule". This allows you to
specify a map of strings to transform in your project name to get the correct
wsdl name.

Basically, you can configure the extension closure with something like:

```groovy
wsdl {
     nameRules = ["-dm" : "DataManagement", "-isl" : "IsSoLong"]
}
```
Now, your project name becomes 

`project-name-isl-dm-ws`

Which is pretty cryptic, yes, but it really reduces the length of your project
name.  And usually, a project will dictate a Service naming convention like
"DataManagement" or "TransactionProcessing" that you can put into a name rule.

I happen to _quite_ like this.

## Binding Previously Genrated Episode Files in JAX-WS

A user can define the episodes wished to be bound (to prevent re-generated
duplicates that have already been generated by the jaxb task).  This is the
`episodes` property, which is just a list of defined episodes, with their extension.

Configure the wsimport task to bind with episode files located under `episodeDirectory` with

```groovy
wsdl {
  episodes = ["name-of-episode-file.episode"]
}
```

or if there are many episode files,

```groovy
wsdl {
  episodes = ["file1", "file2", "file3"].collect { it + ".episode" }
}
```

Improvements
============

If you think this plugin could be better, please fork it! If you have an idea
that would make something a little easier, I'd love to hear about it.

In my head, I see a few [possible improvements](docs/possible-improvements.md)
